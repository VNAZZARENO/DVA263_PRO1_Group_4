# Project Overview

This project addresses the problem of regressing the 'risk_evaluation' metric from the car dataset. The goal is to implement a machine learning pipeline to solve the problem, including preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, validation, and evaluation.

## Steps to Reproduce Results

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone DVA263_PRO1_Group_4.git
   cd DVA263_PRO1_Group_4
   ```

2. **Prepare the Dataset:**
   - Download the dataset from the provided links.
   - Extract the dataset into the `data/` directory.

3. **Run the Preprocessing Pipeline:**
   ```bash
   python preprocessing.py
   ```

4. **Train the Model:**
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

5. **Evaluate the Model:**
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```

6. **Visualize Results:**
   - Results will be stored in `results/` as images or CSV files.
   - Use `notebooks/visualization.ipynb` for further analysis.
