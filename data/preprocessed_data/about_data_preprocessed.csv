"The Simusafe data set contains features extracted from three sources, i.e., vehicular data, neurophysiological signals and data from video analysis. In addition to that, scenario data are added to identify the experiment time, lap, and subject. The following attributes are extracted from the data mentioned above. The attributes in bold can be used as target variables, and the rest of the attributes should be used as features. Numerical attributes are extracted from the vehicular data and neurophysiological data. On the other hand, categorical and binary attributes are extracted from the video analysis data (see the code book tab).

The was collected from two experiments: one is driving in a simulator, and the other is driving in a track. The same participants were used in both experiments. Data from these two experiments are stored in the files ""Feature_Track.xlsx"" and ""Feature_Simulation.xlsx"", respectively. In addition, the ""presentation n#1_CARS.pdf"" file presents the experimental protocol.",,,,,,,,,
